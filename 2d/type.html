           <h1>Social Commentary Series 1 - Type as Metaphor</h1>
           <p>This project aims to use type as metaphor to convey ideas. 
            My topic is about the constructed social standards and mass media in China. </p>
               <!-- I designed three posters. The first one is to criticize a regulation implied on mass 
               media. The second poster is about censorship. The third one is about internet firewall. -->

            <h3>Socialistic Filtering</h3>
            <p><i>Requirements: use paragraph, word, and letter.</i></p>
            <p>This first poster criticizes the impact of constructed social 
                standards and mass media on cultural diversity. The funnel-shaped text cites a government 
                regulation on the images of celebrities on TV shows and other mass media. An increasing 
                number of such regulations will eventually act as a funnel to filter out a society's 
                cultural diversity.</p></div>

            <h3>Censorship</h3>
            <p><i>Requirements: use word and letter.</i></p>
            <p>This one is about the excessive censorship of Chinese mass media. The overused 
                censorship of news and mass media severely affects the freedom of the 
                press and the freedom of media. In this poster, the &quot;t&quot; is changed to 
                &quot;f&quot; by &quot;censor,&quot; which is a metaphor for the inappropriate use of 
                censorship in mass media and news.</p></div>

            <h3>Firewall</h3>
            <p><i>Requirements: use letter only.</i></p>
            <p>This one visualizes how the Internet firewall works in China. It prevents people from 
                accessing information outside the Internet firewall. Internet firewall also prevents 
                voices inside the wall from being heard by the world. Thus, freedom of speech and the 
                right to know are undermined by the firewall.</p></div>

            <h3>Blind or Dies</h3>
            <p>This work is based on traditional Chinese couplets and
                couplet dolls. Usually, the words on the couplets are blessings and good wishes
                for the New Year. I recreated it by changing the blessing words to &quot;blind&quot;
                and &quot;dies&quot; to reflect on obscurantism that people are either put to death
                or become fools knowing nothing.<br><br></p>

            <h3>Shadow</h3>
            <p>This work is created from a collection of &quot;404&quot; errors
                (the rooster) and an alert page (the shadow) of a banned commentary article about a recent social
                issue. I use a rooster as a metaphor for China, because the shape of the Chinese territory is very
                similar to a rooster.
                So I visually present that people living in China are under the shadow of no freedom
                of speech.<br><br></p>

            <h3>Under the Light</h3>
            <p>This work also criticizes obscurantism which makes people only
                see what they want to see and what is good on the surface, while turning a blind eye
                to injustice. However, only seeing what they want to see can never solve real problems.<br><br></p>
